# tweedstreets: procedural street geometry

Tweedstreets uses procedural modelling to automatically generate 3D models of streets given some data, such as real-life data from OpenStreetMap. A graph editor in chordatlas is used to make a basic structure of the streets with nodes connected by lines. This graph is then used to make meshes for the streets and junctions and texture them.
